The Course that "Maximilian" create in this lecture is so powerful for grasp the
concept from basic to advance about TypeScript either you are reading the
Documentation for
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html).

In every lecture and sub-lecture I try to write down the concept that "Max"
trying to say it in his lecture. so this is his lecture I try to grasp:

1. Using Types for a better Code
2. Understanding the TypeScript Compiler
3. TypeScript and ES6
4. Using Classes to create Objects
5. Namespaces and Modules
6. Doing Contract Work with Interfaces
7. Generics
8. Behind the Scenes with Decorators
9. Using JavaScript Libraries like JQuery with TypeScript
10. TypeScript Workflows
11. Example Using TypeScript together with ReactJS


How to read this lecture:

1. npm start
2. open new terminal and run "tsc -w" to edit the code.

The code I wrote is on the "ts-files" folders.
