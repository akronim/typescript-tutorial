/*
& AND   
    Returns a result with a 1 in each position that both inputs have a 1.

| OR    
    Returns a result with a 1 in each position where either input has a 1.

^ XOR   
    Returns a result with a 1 in each position where exactly one input 
    has a 1.

<< Left Shift   
    Bits in the left-hand argument are moved to the left by the number of
bits specified in the right-hand argument. Bits moved off the left side are
discarded and zeroes are added on the right side.

>> Right Shift  
    Bits in the left-hand argument are moved to the right by the number of
bits specified in the right-hand argument. Bits moved off the right side
are discarded and digits matching the left most bit are added on the left
side.

>>> Zero-fill Right Shift   
    Bits in the left-hand argument are moved to the right by the number of
bits specified in the right-hand argument. Bits moved off the right side
are discarded and zeroes are added on the left side.

~ NOT   
    Accepts a single argument and inverts each bit.
