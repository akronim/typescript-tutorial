The “is a” test in object-orientation involves describing the relationship 
between objects to validate that the subclass is indeed a specialized version 
of the superclass. 

For example, “a Cat is a Mammal” and “a Savings Account is a Bank Account.” 

It is usually clear when the relationship is not valid, for example, “a Motor
Car is a Chassis” doesn’t work, but “a Car has a Chassis” does. 

A “has a” relationship requires delegation (or forwarding), not inheritance.

With mixins, the relationship is best described by a “can do” relationship, 
for example:
An actor can do acting.
Or
An actor acts.
